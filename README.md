Blockchain structures created by using Node JS


Install Node JS first. To check the version of Node JS & npm installed , type

node --version

npm --version


After that, We'll need one more package for the code to run i.e. Crypto JS.
To install that, simply type this command in command prompt/terminal:

npm install crypto-js

Next step is to create the main.js file and execute it by using command:

node main.js
